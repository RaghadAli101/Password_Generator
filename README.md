1. Application Setup:
   - The application is created using the tkinter library.
   - It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating random passwords.
   - Users can select the strength and length of the password.

2. User Interface:
   - The GUI includes a title, options for selecting password strength, a password length input field, a password generation button, and a result label.
   - Users can choose between "POOR," "AVERAGE," and "STRONG" password strengths.
   - Users can specify the desired password length using a Spinbox.
   - Clicking the "Generate Password" button generates and displays the password.

3. Password Strength Selection:
   - Users can select one of three password strength levels:
     - "POOR" (Only uppercase and lowercase letters)
     - "AVERAGE" (Letters and digits)
     - "STRONG" (Letters, digits, and special symbols)

4. Password Length Selection:
   - Users can specify the length of the password using the Spinbox.
   - The Spinbox allows selecting a length between 4 and 24 characters.

5. Password Generation:
   - Clicking the "Generate Password" button triggers the password generation process.
   - The password is generated based on the selected strength and length.
   - The generated password is displayed in the result label.

6. Conclusion:
   - This Python password generator application provides users with the flexibility to create random passwords of different strengths and lengths.
   - Users can easily select their desired password strength and length using the GUI interface.
   - The application generates secure passwords based on user preferences.

Note: This documentation offers an overview of the code structure and functionality. Detailed code comments are available within the Python script for a more comprehensive understanding of the implementation.
